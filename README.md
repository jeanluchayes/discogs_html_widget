# Discogs Html Widget
Working Version of Simple Discogs Album Embed. example embed.txt shows how to embed this, as I uploaded it to my Web Server Already.

Embeds one album, like the bandcamp embeded player, which is what I wanted to "replicate".

Example:

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 600px; height: 400px;" src="https://www.jeanluckhayes.com/EmbeddedDiscogsViewer/discogs_album_embed.html?release=13930194"</iframe>

You can put the above on your website and replace the "release=***" with the specific discogs release you want.

Note, the specific release id, not the master listing id.
